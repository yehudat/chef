# Install pyslang so that the project can take advantage of the SystemVerilog
# front‑end provided by the slang compiler.  pyslang exposes the full slang
# front‑end via Python bindings.  This will automatically pull in any
# additional Python build requirements (via PEP 517) when available.  If
# wheels are not available for your platform, pip will fall back to a source
# build which uses CMake; see the Dockerfile for build prerequisites.
